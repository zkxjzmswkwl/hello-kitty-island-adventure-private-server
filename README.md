Things not included, from what I can remember
- OpenVPN creds
- CrowdStrike deployment shit (they didn't include a way to remove this, so any player who competed during COVID still has this service running.)
- Anything that included identifiable information or detailed internal company (aside from the self-hosted chocolatey instance).

Nothing in here is interesting from a tech perspective. It's horrible code. All of it sucks. Uploaded for the novelty.
